        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>From an early age, i was captivated by the world of technology and creativity. What started as simple curiosity about how websites function soon turned into an unstoppable passion for web development. As a student, they spent countless hours exploring HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, eager to bring their ideas to life.

            
            Now, as a web developer, i thrives on turning ideas into reality. Their journey from a student to a professional is a testament to their dedication, resilience, and love for crafting meaningful user experiences. Whether it's designing a sleek portfolio, developing a dynamic web application, or solving complex coding problems, they approach every project with the same excitement that first sparked their interest in web development.
            
            With a strong foundation in front-end and back-end technologies, i  am always eager to innovate, collaborate, and push the boundaries of web development. Their journey is just beginning, and the best is yet to come.
